    "passage": "Passage 1: Informational Text Frottage, a technique developed in the early 20th century, is the art of creating texture by rubbing a surface with a pencil or crayon. Originating from the French word *frotter*, meaning to rub, frottage involves placing paper over a textured surface\u2014such as wood grain, leaves, or stone\u2014and gently rubbing to reveal the texture below. This method highlights intricate patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed. Frottage gained prominence as part of the Surrealist movement. Artists like Max Ernst used it to layer abstract forms resembling landscapes or creatures. Beyond artistic uses, archaeologists use frottage to document carvings, and educators use it to teach about texture. A similar technique, brass rubbing, captures details from memorial plaques but focuses on precision and detail."
